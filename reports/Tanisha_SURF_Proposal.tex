\section{Introduction}
% Introduce LIGO and bring in how your project contributes to LIGO research.
The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detects gravitational waves by measuring incredibly small distortions in spacetime using highly sensitive laser interferometers. One critical limitation to LIGO’s sensitivity, particularly at low frequencies, is quantum noise, which includes shot noise and radiation pressure noise. Squeezed light injection — a technique that reduces quantum noise — is thus vital to LIGO's performance enhancements.

This project directly contributes to this effort by developing a detailed noise budget analysis for a Waveguided Optical Parametric Amplification (WOPA) experiment. In this experiment, several decibels of quantum squeezing at \SI{1064}{\nano\meter} are generated by pumping a Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) waveguide with \SI{532}{\nano\meter} light. The squeezed \SI{1064}{\nano\meter} beam is then combined with a local oscillator (LO) to prepare it for eventual injection into an interferometer similar to those used in LIGO. Calculating the noise budget for frequency noise and phase noise in this system is essential to ensuring that we meet the squeezing levels ($> 6 dB$) required for meaningful improvements in LIGO sensitivity.

\section{Objective}
% Set goals for yourself here.
The main goals of this project are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To calculate and quantify the noise budget, particularly focusing on frequency noise and phase noise contributions, for the WOPA setup described.  Additionally, to address and quantify other sources of noise such as polarisation mismatch, gain imbalance at the balanced homodyne detector (BHD), mode-matching errors between the local oscillator (LO) and signal fields, and residual intensity noise.
    \item To establish tolerances for phase stability that ensure more than \SI{6}{\decibel} of observed squeezing.
    %\item To provide practical recommendations to mitigate these noise sources for successful integration of the squeezed source into an interferometric gravitational wave detector like LIGO.
    \item To determine the necessary length scale for suppressing laser frequency noise, such that the difference in path lengths between the interferometric arms in LIGO is less than 10 cm, given the current frequency variation of 70 MHz. This will involve quantifying how frequency noise translates into path length variations and setting requirements for laser stabilization to meet stringent interferometric precision.
\end{itemize}


\section{Approach}
% Describe a working plan. Cite an article like \cite{PDH}.
The project will be conducted in the following manner:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Model the squeezed light source using the theoretical framework of quantum optics, particularly the impact of frequency noise and phase noise on the squeezed quadratures.
    \item Analyze the WOPA optical setup, including the PPLN waveguide, LO phase shifter, and detection optics, using parameters extracted from the experimental layout.
    \item Develop noise transfer functions that describe how laser frequency noise and LO phase noise couple into the measured squeezed quadrature.
    \item Simulate the noise degradation using the mathematical relationship between squeezing, anti-squeezing, and phase noise.
    \item Validate noise budgets experimentally against squeezing degradation thresholds, setting allowable noise levels to meet $>\SI{6}{\decibel}$ observed squeezing.
    \item Propose methods to control phase noise, such as active feedback stabilization and passive noise reduction.
\end{itemize}
