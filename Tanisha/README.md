| 29-05-25&nbsp;&nbsp; | - Optical fibre-PM-1064P3, Beat length-2.5mm <br> Read the Optical Fiber [**Birefringence Effects â€“ Sources,Utilization and Methods of Suppression, Drexler**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221923065_Optical_Fiber_Birefringence_Effects_Sources_Utilization_and_Methods_of_Suppression) to understand polarization change in op fib.<br>- We worked in the Lab- the entire working of the setup became clear. First time Squeezing achieved= -0.14 dBs of Squeezing, +0.29 dBs of Anti-Squeezing |-The radius of coil and length of fibre can be changed in terms of poliz mismatch to correct the change of linear to elliptical polariz on passing through the fibre<br>- Known noise causes- Polarization mismatch- (91% LP for 532nm before entering crystal), mode matching error(~ 100 micro m), gain balancing error (~10^-6 v/rHz), optical losses(?), MOKU- Go gave two peaks in the low frequency region below 2 MHz (Even after subtraction of shot noise how much does laser frequency noise matter?)<br>-Read elog| 
| 30-05-25            |- Analysed the data of a previous measurement with out squeezing| - Refer code and elog|
| 31-05-25            |- Wrote the abstract again. Read the comparison of WOPA and OPO (Mckenzie thesis)| -Refer doc
